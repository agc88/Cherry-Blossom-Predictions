#Kyoto is not displaying for an unknown reason, but on the previous measurement
#with temperature accounted for it came out to roughly +2 more than Vancouver, 
#+4 more than DC, and +6 more than #Liestal. These respective parameters would be
#+ 7.625, +0.146, and +6.482. Since the DC value is different than it was previously

#the other two to obtain a parameter of +7.054 for Kyoko.
